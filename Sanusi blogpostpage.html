            <h2>How I Built a Traffic Light System Using a 4017</h2>
            
            <h3>Key Steps</h3>
            <p>In this post, I’m excited to share my journey of building a simple traffic light circuit using a 555 timer and a CD4017 decade counter:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I started by learning how the 555 timer produces clock pulses, which was fascinating!</li>
                <li>Next, I connected the CD4017 to manage the sequence of the LEDs, which was like putting together a puzzle.</li>
                <li>After that, I tested the timing for the red, yellow, and green lights to ensure everything was working smoothly.</li>
                <li>Finally, I assembled the circuit on a breadboard and observed the output with great excitement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This project not only deepened my understanding of timing control and digital logic but also sparked my interest in embedded systems design.</p>

            <h2>My Experience During SIWES</h2>
            <p>In this post, I want to share my incredible experience during the Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I honed my soldering and desoldering skills on actual circuit boards, which was both challenging and rewarding.</li>
                <li>Through hands-on practice, I learned to identify components like resistors, capacitors, and ICs—things I had only read about.</li>
                <li>I got to work on assembling regulated power supply circuits, which gave me a real feel for practical electronics.</li>
                <li>It was enlightening to see how what I learned in class applied to real-world engineering tasks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> My time during SIWES significantly boosted my confidence in circuit design and reinforced my academic knowledge with practical experience.</p>

            <h2>How I Learned HTML Basics in One Hour</h2>
            <p>In this post, I’d like to share how I quickly picked up the basics of HTML and started applying them in real projects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I followed a beginner-friendly online guide, which made the learning process enjoyable.</li>
                <li>I created small web pages using headers, lists, and images, which felt like a fun creative outlet.</li>
                <li>I experimented by editing sample templates to incorporate my own details, which was quite satisfying.</li>
                <li>Eventually, I connected these pages to build a simple portfolio website, and I was thrilled with the result!</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Learning HTML was a wonderful experience! It was straightforward and fun, and it gave me the confidence to merge my interests in electronics and web interfaces for future projects.</p>
